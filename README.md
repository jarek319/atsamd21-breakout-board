A Boilerplate for the ATSAMD21 microcontroller

The ATSAMD21 is one of my favorite microcontroller families. It's low cost and ease of programming made me want to create a board that suits my project needs, so it contains RTC circuitry, an SD card slot, and a few other helpful dev touches.
The board was produced, plugged in, and did not emit magic smoke. All of the functionality hasn't been tested yet.
